# LoadBalance_V1
A sample project for LoadBalancer with different distribution algorithms

Based on the requirements, you can edit host IPs from IpPool.java and run LoadBalanceMain.java file. I have discarded/added some parts
which has asked in the case study but I think it is working the same way.

To test the project, just clone the repository, add Java SDK to path and run.

Feel free to give feedbacks!
